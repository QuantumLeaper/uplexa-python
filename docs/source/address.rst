Addresses and payment IDs
=========================
The first, original address of the wallet is usually known as the *master
address*. All others are just *subaddresses*, even if they represent a separate
account within the wallet.

uPlexa addresses are base58-encoded strings. You may disassemble each of them
using the excellent `address analysis tool`_ from *luigi1111*.

While the ordinary string representation is perfectly valid to use, you may
want to use validation and other features provided by the ``uplexa.address``
package.

Address validation and instatination
------------------------------------

The function ``uplexa.address.address()`` will recognize and validate uPlexa
address, returning an instance that provides additional functionality.

The following example uses addresses from the wallet :doc:`we have generated in
the previous chapter <wallet>`.

Let's start with the master address:

.. code-block:: python

    In [1]: from uplexa.address import address

    In [2]: a = address('UPX1ffK8ybGjhjQXReRxLDKPRBrsjXEzLcLGuHQZdmCBMd95K6PULopLLafQZf1MCCQoqf8mFEcnvhbP8n5SXtkN4F9Q3jN3Ru')

    In [3]: a.is_testnet()
    Out[3]: True

    In [4]: a.spend_key()
    Out[4]: 'f0481b63cb937fa5960529247ebf6db627ff1b0bb88de9feccc3c504c16aa4b0'

    In [5]: a.view_key()
    Out[5]: '2c5ba76d22e48a7ea4ddabea3cce66808ba0cc91265371910f893962e977af1e'

    In [6]: type(a)
    Out[6]: uplexa.address.Address

We may use a subaddress too:

.. code-block:: python

    In [7]: b = address('UPX1ffK8ybGjhjQXReRxLDKPRBrsjXEzLcLGuHQZdmCBMd95K6PULopLLafQZf1MCCQoqf8mFEcnvhbP8n5SXtkN4F9Q3jN3Ru')

    In [8]: b.is_testnet()
    Out[8]: True

    In [9]: b.spend_key()
    Out[9]: 'ae7e136f46f618fe7f4a6b323ed60864c20070bf110978d7e3868686d5677318'

    In [10]: b.view_key()
    Out[10]: '2bf801cdaf3a8b41020098a6d5e194f48fa62129fe9d8f09d19fee9260665baa'

    In [11]: type(b)
    Out[11]: uplexa.address.SubAddress

These two classes, ``Address`` and ``SubAddress`` have similar functionality
but one significant difference. Only the former may form *integrated address*.

Generating subaddresses
-----------------------

It is possible to get subaddresses in two ways:

 1. Creating them in the wallet file by calling ``.new_address()`` on ``Account`` or ``Wallet``
    instance.  In properly synced wallet this will return an address that is guaranteed to be fresh
    and unused.  It is the right way if you plan to use one-time addresses to identify payments or
    to improve your privacy by avoiding address reuse.
 2. Requesting arbitrary subaddress by calling ``Wallet.get_address(major, minor)`` where ``major``
    is the account index and ``minor`` is the index of the address within an account. Addresses
    obtained this way are not guaranteed to be fresh and **will not be saved as already generated
    within the wallet file**. (Watch out for unintentional address reuse!)

Payment IDs and integrated addresses
------------------------------------

Each uPlexa transaction may carry a **payment ID**. It is a 64 or 256-bit long
number that carries additional information between parties. For example, a
merchant can generate a payment ID for each order, or an exchange can assign
one to each user. The customer/user would then attach the ID to the transaction,
so the site operator would know what is the purpose of incoming payment.

A short, 64-bit payment ID can be integrated into an address, creating, well...
an **integrated address**.

.. code-block:: python

    In [12]: ia = a.with_payment_id(0xfeedbadbeef)

    In [13]: ia
    Out[13]: ABySz66nm1QUhPiwoAbR2tXU9LJu2U6fJjcsv3rxgkVRWU6tEYcn6C1NBc7wqCv5V7NW3zeYuzKf6RGGgZTFTpVC623BT1ptXvVU2GjR1B

    In [14]: ia.base_address()
    Out[14]: A2GmyHHJ9jtUhPiwoAbR2tXU9LJu2U6fJjcsv3rxgkVRWU6tEYcn6C1NBc7wqCv5V7NW3zeYuzKf6RGGgZTFTpVC4QxAiAX

    In [15]: ia.base_address() == a
    Out[15]: True

    In [16]: ia.payment_id()
    Out[16]: 00000feedbadbeef


Since subaddresses have been introduced, merchants may generate a separate
address for each order, user or any other object they expect the payments
coming to. Therefore, it has been decided that `subaddresses cannot generate
integrated addresses`_.

.. _`subaddresses cannot generate integrated addresses`

.. code-block:: python

    In [17]: b.with_payment_id(0xfeedbadbeef)
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

        102
        103

    TypeError: SubAddress cannot be integrated with payment ID

The ``uplexa.numbers.PaymentID`` class validates payment IDs. It accepts both
integer and hexadecimal string representations.

.. code-block:: python

    In [18]: from uplexa.numbers import PaymentID

    In [19]: p1 = PaymentID(0xfeedbadbeef)

    In [20]: p2 = PaymentID('feedbadbeef')

    In [21]: p1 == p2
    Out[21]: True

    In [22]: p1.is_short()
    Out[22]: True

    In [23]: p3 = PaymentID('1234567890abcdef0')

    In [24]: p3
    Out[24]: 000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001234567890abcdef0

    In [25]: p3.is_short()
    Out[25]: False

Long payment IDs cannot be integrated:

.. code-block:: python

    In [26]: a.with_payment_id(p3)
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
